    -   Adding hotspots: In the bottom-right corner of the screen, you can add an info hotspot, a link hotspot, and you can also set the initial view. Info hotspots display text when clicked, and link hotspots take viewers to a new image of the tour when clicked. When you add a hotspot, you can drag it to the point in your image that you would like it to be displayed
