# Introduction to Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, & 360 Tours

- Pre-workshop activities: 7 min 
- Introductory presentation: 10 min
- Hands-on activities: 80 min

## Why Create VR, AR, & 360 Tours?

Let's start with some definitions so that we are all on the same page: 
- **Virtual Reality** or **VR** is a computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using equipment like VR Goggles that covers their complete field of view. [More information about VR](https://guides.library.utoronto.ca/c.php?g=607624&p=4938314).{:target="_blank"}.
- **Augmented Reality** or **AR** is a technology that lets people superimpose digital content (images, sounds, text) over a real-world environment. This is most commonly done using smart phone applications (like Pokemon Go) or less commonly using specialized headset glasses (like Microsoft Hololens). [More information about AR](https://www.threekit.com/blog/what-is-augmented-reality).{:target="_blank"}.  
- **360 Tours & 360 Video** are... Marzipano 360 Tour, Lapentor 360 Tour, Google Earth Narrative Map

- VR, AR, & 360 Video viewed using headsets that take up the viewers full field of view can make for a much more impactiful experience for people than a similar experience using a smart phone or computer. One example of this is... 360 video research in refugee camps leads to higher empathy than people who watched regular videos on their computers or phones.
- Heightened spatial understanding/immersion for Augmented Reality and 360 Tours
- Point of need information is available to people using AR apps...

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Explain the difference between Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR), 360 Video, and 360 Tours
2. Create a 360 Tour using Marzipano
3. Create a Google Virtual Tour using a mix of Google Street View and personal 360 images
4. Create a Tour using Google Earth Narrative Map
5. Create an Augmented Reality experience on a mobile phone
