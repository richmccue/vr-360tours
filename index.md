# Introduction to Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, & 360 Tours

- Pre-workshop activities: 7 min 
- Introductory presentation: 10 min
- Hands-on activities: 80 min

## Why Create VR, AR, & 360 Tours?

Let's start with some definitions so that we are all on the same page: 
- **Virtual Reality** or **VR** is a computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using equipment like VR Goggles that covers their complete field of view. [More information about VR](https://guides.library.utoronto.ca/c.php?g=607624&p=4938314).{:target="_blank"}.
- **Augmented Reality** or **AR** is a technology that lets people superimpose digital content (images, sounds, text) over a real-world environment. This is most commonly done using smart phone applications (like Pokemon Go) or less commonly using specialized AR headset glasses (like Microsoft Hololens). [More information about AR](https://www.threekit.com/blog/what-is-augmented-reality).{:target="_blank"}.  
- **360 Tours & 360 Video** can be viewed in VR headsets, but are more commonly viewed on smartphones and web browsers. 360-Tours are a series of 360-degree still photograpi that the viewer navigates through at their own pace, and can have embeded photos, videos and text in them. 

### Benefits of VR, AR, & 360 Tours
VR, AR, 360-Tours, and 360-Videos viewed using headsets that take up the viewers full field of view can make for a much more impactiful experience for people than a similar experience using a smart phone or computer. One example of this is... 360 video research in refugee camps leads to higher empathy than people who watched regular videos on their computers or phones.

Another benefit is Heightened spatial understanding/immersion for Augmented Reality and 360 Tours

AR is a great tool to privide point of need information to people using smartphone AR apps.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Explain the difference between Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR), 360 Video, and 360 Tours
2. Create a 360 Tour using Marzipano
3. Create a Google Virtual Tour using a mix of Google Street View and personal 360 images
4. Create a Tour using Google Earth Narrative Map
5. Create an Augmented Reality experience on a mobile phone
