# Introduction to Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, & 360 Tours

- Pre-workshop activities: 7 min 
- Introductory presentation: 10 min
- Hands-on activities: 80 min

## Why Create VR, AR, & 360 Tours?

VR & 360 Video emersion can make for a much more impactiful experience for people using headsets that cover their full vield view.
One example of this is... 360 video research in refugee camps leads to higher empathy than people who watched regular videos on their computers or phones.
Heightened spatial understanding/immersion for Augmented Reality and 360 Tours
Point of need information is available to people using AR apps...


Let's start with some definitions so that we are all on the same page. 
- **Virtual Reality** or **VR** is a computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using equipment like VR Goggles.
- **Augmented Reality** or **AR** is... Augmented Reality (AR) Activity (coming soon)
- **360 Tours & 360 Video** are... Marzipano 360 Tour, Lapentor 360 Tour, Google Earth Narrative Map

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Explain the difference between Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR), 360 Video, and 360 Tours
2. Create a 360 Tour using Marzipano
3. Create a Google Virtual Tour using a mix of Google Street View and personal 360 images
4. Create a Tour using Google Earth Narrative Map
5. Create an Augmented Reality experience on a mobile phone
